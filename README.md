# Loan Approval Prediction

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan approvals using machine learning models in Jupyter Notebook. 
The dataset includes various applicant details that influence the loan approval process.

Tools and Libraries Used
The following libraries were used in the project:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization.
- seaborn: For advanced visualizations.
- sklearn: For building machine learning models, including:
  - `sklearn.linear_model`
  - `sklearn.model_selection`
  - `sklearn.ensemble`
  - `sklearn.svm`
  - `sklearn.neighbors`

How to Run the Project
1. Install Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the `LoanApprovalPrediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter.
3. Run the cells step by step to load the data, preprocess it, and build the models.

Key Steps
The notebook involves the following main steps:
1. Importing the necessary libraries.
2. Loading and exploring the dataset.
3. Preprocessing the data (handling missing values and encoding).
4. Building machine learning models using various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
5. Evaluating the models to find the best-performing one.
